# AI Voice Interview MVP - Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript template
- [x] Set up project directory structure (src/, components/, lib/, types/)
- [x] Configure environment variables (.env.local)
- [x] Set up OpenAI API integration structure
- [x] Create basic TypeScript interfaces and types

## Phase 2: Core Components Development
- [x] **ResumeUpload.tsx** - File upload component with drag-and-drop
- [x] **VoiceRecorder.tsx** - Audio recording with Web Audio API
- [x] **InterviewProgress.tsx** - Progress tracking UI
- [x] **ScoreDisplay.tsx** - Score visualization component
- [x] **Results.tsx** - Final results and feedback display

## Phase 3: API Routes Implementation
- [x] **/api/parse-resume** - Resume parsing endpoint
- [x] **/api/speech-to-text** - Whisper API integration
- [x] **/api/text-to-speech** - TTS API integration
- [x] **/api/analyze-response** - Response analysis logic
- [x] **/api/calculate-score** - Final scoring algorithm
- [x] **/api/conversation-manager** - Dynamic conversation flow
- [x] **/api/generate-avatar-video** - HeyGen video generation

## Phase 4: Core Logic Implementation
- [x] **resume-parser.ts** - Resume processing logic
- [x] **audio-utils.ts** - Audio handling utilities
- [x] **interview-engine.ts** - Interview flow management
- [x] **conversational-interviewer.ts** - Dynamic conversation system
- [x] **voice-manager.ts** - Voice synthesis management
- [x] **avatar-service.ts** - HeyGen avatar integration
- [x] Implement question generation based on resume
- [x] Create scoring algorithm with weighted categories

## Phase 5: Interview Flow Integration
- [x] Connect resume upload to question generation
- [x] Implement voice recording flow
- [x] Add real-time transcription feedback
- [x] Create interview state management
- [x] Add progress tracking throughout interview

## Phase 6: UI/UX Enhancement
- [x] Style all components with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Add loading states and skeletons
- [x] Implement error handling UI
- [x] Add microphone permission handling
- [x] Create responsive design

## Phase 7: Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Test complete interview flow
- [ ] Optimize API call performance
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for API failures
- [ ] Test audio quality across browsers
- [ ] Performance testing (<2s latency target)

## Phase 8: Polish and Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle API rate limiting
- [ ] Add fallback for audio issues
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add interview tips/guidance
- [ ] Final UI polish

## Notes
- Using localStorage for MVP (no database)
- Server-side API calls only for OpenAI
- Focus on core functionality over aesthetics
- Target modern browsers only

## Current Status
- Complete conversational interview system working
- Resume parsing with quality feedback implemented
- Voice recording and real-time transcription functional
- Dynamic question generation based on conversation context
- Scoring and results display completed
- Video avatar integration with HeyGen API (with audio fallback)
- Ready for testing and optimization

## Phase 9: Video Avatar Integration ✅
- [x] **AvatarVideoPlayer.tsx** - Video player with audio fallback
- [x] **AvatarSelector.tsx** - Avatar selection UI
- [x] **AvatarManager.tsx** - Avatar management and testing
- [x] HeyGen API integration with error handling
- [x] Video caching system for performance
- [x] Audio fallback when video generation fails
- [x] Multiple test endpoints for debugging

## Known Issues & Next Steps
- HeyGen video generation returns BAD REQUEST - need to debug API format
- Consider alternative video avatar services if HeyGen issues persist
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization for video generation
- Add interview recording and playback features
