  1. **Experience Duration** (highest priority)
  2. **Company Names** 
  3. **Specific Projects**
  4. **Job Roles**
  5. **Challenges Mentioned**
  6. **Technologies** (lowest priority)

#### 🎪 **Forced Contextual Questions**
- **Mandatory Entity Usage**: AI MUST ask about Priority 1 entity
- **Exact Word Matching**: Uses candidate's exact words in follow-up
- **Forbidden Generic Questions**: Cannot ask unrelated questions

### Technical Implementation

#### **Enhanced Topic Analysis**
```typescript
// Now extracts specific entities with regex patterns
- Years: /(\d+)\s*(year|yr|month|week)/gi
- Companies: /at\s+([A-Z][a-zA-Z\s&]+?)(?:\s|,|\.)/g
- Projects: /built\s+(?:a\s+)?([a-zA-Z\s]+?)(?:\s|,|\.)/gi
```

#### **Explicit Priority System**
- Sorts entities by importance for interview value
- Forces AI to focus on most relevant follow-up
- Prevents generic question fallbacks

#### **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
- Full prompt visibility for troubleshooting
- Entity extraction logging
- AI response tracking

### Real-World Examples

#### **Before (Generic)**:
- User: "I have 5 years experience at TechCorp building React apps"

## [3.1.0] - 2025-01-23

### CRITICAL FIX: Resume-Based Questions Only

### Problem Solved
Users reported AI was going too deep into projects and not asking technical questions, plus asking about technologies not in their resume.

### Changes Made

#### 🎯 **Resume-Only Question Policy**
- **ONLY ask about skills explicitly listed in candidate's resume**
- **NEVER introduce new technologies they haven't mentioned**
- **FORBIDDEN to ask about skills not in their background**

#### 📊 **Balanced Interview Structure**
- **Projects**: Maximum 2-3 questions, then transition
- **Technical Skills**: Questions about their LISTED technologies only
- **Problem Solving**: Scenarios using their ACTUAL tech stack
- **Behavioral**: Related to their specific experience

#### 🔄 **Smart Topic Transitions** 
- Track project-related questions (limit to 2-3 max)
- After project discussion → "Great project work! I see you have [THEIR SKILL] in your skills. How do you..."
- Focus on technical skills from their resume
- Ask about debugging, best practices, code quality in THEIR technologies

### Example Conversation Flow

**Before (Bad)**:
```
User: "I built a React dashboard..."  
AI: "Tell me more about the database design..." (not on resume)
AI: "How do you handle microservices?" (not on resume)  
AI: "What about Kubernetes deployment?" (not on resume)
```

**Now (Good)**:
```  
User: "I built a React dashboard..."
AI: "Great project! I see you have JavaScript and React in your skills. How do you typically handle state management in React?"
AI: "Excellent! Since you mentioned CSS, what's your approach to responsive design?"
AI: "Perfect! Given your Node.js experience, how do you structure your API endpoints?"
```

### Technical Implementation
- Enhanced conversation manager to track project depth
- Added resume skill validation in prompts
- Automatic transitions after 2-3 project questions
- Forbidden list prevents off-topic technical questions

### Impact
- **Relevant Questions**: All questions based on candidate's actual skills
- **Balanced Coverage**: Projects, technical skills, problem-solving, behavioral
- **No Deep Dives**: Limits project discussion to prevent endless details
- **Technical Focus**: Ensures technical assessment of their ACTUAL skills

This ensures interviews are comprehensive yet focused on the candidate's real background and expertise.
