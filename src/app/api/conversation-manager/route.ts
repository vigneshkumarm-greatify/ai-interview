üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. ALL questions MUST be based on skills/technologies from their RESUME
2. NEVER ask about technologies they haven't mentioned or don't have
3. BALANCE between project details, technical skills, and problem-solving
4. LIMIT project deep-dives to 2-3 questions maximum
5. TRANSITION to technical questions about their ACTUAL skills

INTERVIEW STRUCTURE:
1. **Project Overview** (2-3 questions max): What they built, main challenges
2. **Technical Skills** (from resume): How they use specific technologies listed
3. **Problem Solving**: Scenarios using their actual tech stack
4. **Best Practices**: Related to their listed skills only
5. **Behavioral**: Team situations, learning experiences

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Only ask about technologies EXPLICITLY in their resume/conversation
- After 2-3 project questions ‚Üí Move to technical skills
- Reference their specific skills when asking technical questions
- Never introduce new technologies they haven't mentioned

CONVERSATION FLOW:
- Acknowledge their response appropriately
- For projects: 2-3 exchanges MAX then transition
- Move to technical questions about their LISTED skills
- Ask problem-solving scenarios using THEIR tech stack

RESPONSE STRUCTURE (EXACT JSON):
{
  "acknowledgment": "[Natural acknowledgment]",
  "nextQuestion": "[Question based on THEIR skills/experience]",
  "responseType": "[follow_up|transition|complete]",
  "shouldScore": [true when transitioning topics],
  "currentTopic": "[project|technical|problem_solving|behavioral]",
  "topicDepth": [number of exchanges on current topic]
}

TRANSITION EXAMPLES:
- "Great project experience! I see you work with [THEIR SKILL]. How do you typically..."
- "Excellent! Since you mentioned [THEIR TECHNOLOGY], can you explain..."
- "That's interesting! Given your experience with [THEIR SKILL], how would you approach..."

FORBIDDEN:
- Asking about technologies not in their resume
- Going too deep into project implementation (max 2-3 questions)
- Generic questions unrelated to their background`;

  ).length;

  return `FULL CONVERSATION HISTORY:
${conversationHistory}

LATEST USER RESPONSE: "${latestResponse}"

CANDIDATE'S RESUME CONTEXT:
- Name: ${resumeContext.name}
- Experience: ${resumeContext.experience}
- ALL SKILLS: ${resumeContext.skills.join(', ')}

SKILL CLASSIFICATION:
- TECHNICAL SKILLS (ask technical questions): ${resumeContext.skills.filter(skill => 
    ['javascript', 'typescript', 'react', 'vue', 'angular', 'node', 'python', 'java', 'html', 'css', 
     'mongodb', 'mysql', 'postgresql', 'redis', 'docker', 'kubernetes', 'aws', 'azure', 'git', 
     'api', 'rest', 'graphql', 'microservices', 'express', 'django', 'flask', 'spring'].some(tech => 
     skill.toLowerCase().includes(tech.toLowerCase()))).join(', ') || 'None identified'}
- BEHAVIORAL SKILLS (ask behavioral questions): ${resumeContext.skills.filter(skill => 
    ['problem-solving', 'empathy', 'leadership', 'communication', 'teamwork', 'management', 
     'collaboration', 'analytical', 'creative'].some(soft => 
     skill.toLowerCase().includes(soft.toLowerCase()))).join(', ') || 'None identified'}

IMPORTANT: Only ask TECHNICAL questions about technical skills, BEHAVIORAL questions about soft skills

CONVERSATION ANALYSIS:
1. Number of project-related questions so far: ${projectExchanges}
2. Did they ask for clarification? ${latestResponse.toLowerCase().includes('what do you mean') || latestResponse.toLowerCase().includes('which') ? 'YES' : 'NO'}
3. Current topic depth: Count how many exchanges on current topic

TASK - Generate response based on these rules:

IF PROJECT DISCUSSION (and already 2-3 project questions):
- Acknowledge their project experience
- TRANSITION to technical questions about their LISTED skills
- Example: "Great project work! I see you have ${resumeContext.skills[0]} in your skills. How do you..."
- Set responseType: "transition", topicDepth: 0

IF NEED TO ASK TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:
- Focus on TECHNICAL SKILLS ONLY (JavaScript, React, Python, APIs, etc.)
- Ask about coding, debugging, implementation, best practices
- Examples for technical skills:
  - "How do you handle state management in React?"
  - "What's your approach to debugging JavaScript issues?"
  - "Can you explain how you structure your API endpoints?"
  - "How do you optimize database queries?"
  - "What testing strategies do you use?"

IF ASKING BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS:
- Focus on BEHAVIORAL SKILLS (problem-solving, empathy, leadership, etc.)
- Ask about situations, examples, team scenarios
- Examples for behavioral skills:
  - "Tell me about a time you used problem-solving to overcome a challenge"
  - "How do you show empathy when working with difficult stakeholders?"
  - "Describe a situation where you had to lead a team through a difficult project"

IF CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
- Apologize and clarify
- Reference their actual skills/experience
- Set responseType: "follow_up"

TOPIC BALANCE CHECK:
- Projects: Maximum 2-3 questions
- Technical Skills: Ask about their LISTED technologies
- Problem Solving: Using their ACTUAL tech stack
- Behavioral: Related to their experience

FORBIDDEN:
- Don't ask about skills NOT in their resume
- Don't go deeper than 3 questions on any project
- Don't ask generic questions unrelated to their background
